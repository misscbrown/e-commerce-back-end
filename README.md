# e-commerce-back-end
Back end for an e-commerce website

Inspiration

This is a bootcamp project, it's important for me to understand more about how e-commerce back ends work, because it is such a huge industry. Most businesses have some sort of e-commerce capabilities, or have/need a back end that requires the manipulation of stock, whether physical or digital. 

Challenges

Getting everything to show up properly in Insomnia with no errors, took a little understanding into how Insomnia works - how to fix a bad request, making sure that the instruction is input correctly - the omission of a coma or speechmark in the wrong place will cause it to not work. I am more confident with Insomnia now and have also played around with Postman. Sequelize took some getting used to and I would like to do further research to gain a more in depth understanding.

Areas for further development

I think pre built back ends for different industries could be a great idea for smaller startups with small teams. Maybe targeting those who have digital products for sale - providing different options for products such as introductory one off offers, limited seasonal offers, pre sale releases for artists and bands - helping to encourage them to think of their music as an asset.

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
